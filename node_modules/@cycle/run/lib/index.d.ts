 * Sink proxies should be MemoryStreams in order to fix race conditions for

 *
 * Recall that there are two steps:
 * 1. Setup (sink proxies -> drivers -> sources -> main -> sink)
 * 2. Execution (also known as replication: sink proxies imitate sinks)
 *
 * If a driver does not synchronously/immediately subscribe to the sink proxy
 * in step (1), but instead does that later, if step (2) feeds a value from the
 * sink to the sink proxy, then when the driver subscribes to the sink proxy,
 * it should receive that value. This is why we need MemoryStreams, not just
 * Streams. Note: Cycle DOM driver is an example of such case, since it waits
 * for 'readystatechange'.

 * the application actually execute. Refer to the documentation of `run()` for
 * more details.
 *
 * **Example:**
 * ```js

 * const {sources, sinks, run} = setup(main, drivers);
 * // ...
 * const dispose = run(); // Executes the application
 * // ...
 * dispose();

 * `sinks`.
 * @param {Object} drivers an object where keys are driver names and values
 * are driver functions.
 * @return {Object} an object with three properties: `sources`, `sinks` and
 * `run`. `sources` is the collection of driver sources, `sinks` is the
 * collection of driver sinks, these can be used for debugging or testing. `run`
 * is the function that once called will execute the application.
